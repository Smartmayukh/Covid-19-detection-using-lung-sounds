# Covid-19-detection-using-lung-sounds

In this project I made a Covid-19 detector which uses Lung sounds to analyse and predict the chances of the disease. I used HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and Google Teachable Machine to make the classifier and the website . Check the website out here :

The Youtube playlist from where I extracted the audio is :

PS: The classifier is very easy to build, Just put the audio files in Google Teachable Machine and then build a classifier. Then import the Jason file in JavaScript, Cook it up with some Html and CSS and vola - the website will be complete.
